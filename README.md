Fuel combustion is a highly complicated process because it is affected by many physical and chemical factors that make the prediction and measurement of ignition delay time a complicated, slow, and expensive process. Ignition delay time is one of the most commonly used control properties in engine combustion research and is defined as the time taken by the fuel to auto-ignite after being injected into the combustion chamber. Traditional experimental methods, such as using infrared radiation detector monitors and time-based pressure sensor measurements, are highly dependent on engine types and are inefficient in general applications due to the multiple variables involved and their non-linear relationships. With the advancement of artificial neural networks, some complex and non-linear models for ignition delay time predictions have been successfully created and have shown very promising results. However, the majority of published neural network models have unchangeable input layer dimensions, which does not encompass different types of fuels or engines. In this project, I introduced new artificial neural network models that include expandable input layer dimensions based on dataset shapes and demand-based numbers of hidden layers and neurons. This project has significantly increased the capabilities of neural network models and the simulation tool, which has wide applications in both rocket and Scramjet combustor designs.
